# tivotranscode #

This little script can be setup as a cron job, and will download, decode, and transcode (using HandBrake-cli) TiVo MPEG recordings into h264 mp4s.

I created this script to run on an old Atom330 Mini-ITX machine so my recordings will automagically end up on my QNAP NAS box in the proper format for my Roku 2's to stream.

The script was written on Debian 6, has been updated for Debian 7, and uses the [deb-multimedia](http://deb-multimedia.org/) repository for some packages.
