TiVo Transcode Is a set of cron-able shell scripts, designed to be a totally 
automated, maintenance-free, method of transcoding TiVo recordings to a 
destination.

I've created this as part of my end-to-end solution for recording live TV with a TiVo premiere, transcoding, and later viewing the recordings on Roku 2 set top boxes or other devices capable of h264 high-profile output.

To that end, the script targets h264 video, and stereo aac in an mp4 (.m4v extension) container.

These scripts are designed to work on Debian Squeeze and Debian Wheezy... with the proper bits installed from the deb-multimedia.org repository...

I'll update this more accurately lately, this script has evolved quite a bit over the last year.
