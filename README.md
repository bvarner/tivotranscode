Currently, this project consists of a cronable shell script which makes use of open-source software to download, decode, and transcode TiVo recordings.

Specifically, I created this to automate the process of taking my TiVo recordings, and transcoding them to h264 (high-profile) for playback on a Roku 2 (should also work really well for raspberry pi's!)
I've been using Debian (started with 6.0, now on 7.0) as my base system this runs on.

I've added the deb-multimedia repository, non-free contrib to all base debian repositories, and the backports repository.

TODO: Instructions for installing (or a deb package!)

Install / Build the tivodecode software ... (put it in the right spot)
